IThe homework zip file contains a main.cpp file

To compile it:

g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -lpthread

to run it: ./a.out <username>

The code is developed base on class code examples, the broadcast ip is hard-coded inside the send fuctions

There are three send functions with similar structures. They are separated for debug convenience

When started, the program will send announcement to the multicast ip and then user can either send message in multicast way or private way (one line of message terminated by '\n')

example:

./a.out wuk3
input: hello world <enter>
output: From: wuk3 hello world
input: /wuk3 hello world private
output: hello world private
