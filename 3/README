The program for homework3 include a main.cpp file

The connection and send parts are developed based on the example code in class

No special requirement for compiling

To run it:

example: ./a.out http://www.asquaredlabs.com/csci4220/ > output.html 2>header.txt

Modifications are made on two parts:

1. only use two buffers: temp_buf and header, and use calloc to put them on the heap--based on the application, no 0 is appended to the end.

2. instead of using str* which consider \0 as termination, only use memcpy.  

The assumption is the header for a http response is never larger than 8KB; it is truefor apache server. Tomcat has a larger header, in that case, this code should be altered by changing the HEADER_LIMIT to a larger number.
