The codes include Connection.cpp Connection.h and main.cpp

The whole idea of implementation can be seen from Connection.h

1. read function is not virtual but it calls a virtual function "myrecv"
   myrecv is a wrapper for recv (TCP) or BIO_read (SSL) depend on the child class
   All other parts are the same for TCP and SSL
	
2. write() is a virtual funciton since the two child classes are totally different

3. In Https_Conn (SSL), the BIO_free_all is implemented in the destructor

The program use codes from class examples.
