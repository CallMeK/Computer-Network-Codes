The code for project 2 include a main.cpp

The code was developed with the reference to code example in class

To compile it:
g++ main.cpp -std=c++11

The code was tested on one machine with three shells

Server : ./a.out

Client 1: node p2_sample_client.js localhost user1

Client 2: node p2_sample_client.js localhost user2 user1

Though it is rare but it happens that the CALL message was captured earlier thanREGISTER, in that case, we need to rerun Client2.
