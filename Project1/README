The program consists of three files, main.cpp, RoutesAnalyzer.h and RoutesAnalyzer.cpp

The compiling is simply:

g++ -c RoutesAnalyzer.cpp
g++ -c main.cpp
g++ main.o RouteAnalyzer.o

To run it for part I:

	Need an empty nat file

	touch nat_empty.txt
	./a.out routes.txt arp.txt nat_empty.txt <pdus.txt

To run it for part II:

	ruby nat_test.rb "./a.out routes.txt arp.txt nat.txt" 


In the code, the function of router is simulated by the function route_and_report in main.cpp

All the classes are implemented in RoutesAnalyzer.h/cpp
