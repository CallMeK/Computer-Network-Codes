The .js file is modified based on the example from HW7

An array of objects are used. 
Each object has a "data_" member to store the response and a "timecreated" to
store the time created.

For this application, the time expiration only occurs when a query comes, that is,
the time check is only to make the result accurate, but not for memory usage.

For memory usage, it may require a time check detached from the major event handler.
